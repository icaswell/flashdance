Your task is to summarize longer definitions of Chinese words into a 1-2 word definition. I am going to give you a series of Chinese words along with their full definitions, and you are going to produce a table that maps each word to this reduced definition.

For example, if I give you the following table:

癌症	cancer
安宁	peaceful; tranquil; calm; composed; free from worry
霸道	the Way of the Hegemon; abbr. for 霸王之道; despotic rule; rule by might; evil as opposed to the Way of the King 王道; overbearing; tyranny; (of liquor, medicine etc) strong; potent
巴不得	(coll.) to be eager for; to long for; to look forward to
现代	modern times; modern age; modern era
不敢当	lit. I dare not (accept the honor); fig. I don't deserve your praise; you flatter me
抖腿黨	n. The leg-shaking gang. People with jittery legs while sitting.
保养	to take good care of (or conserve) one's health; to keep in good repair; to maintain; maintenance

You would return the following table:

癌症	cancer
安宁	tranquil
霸道	despotic
巴不得	eager
现代	modern times
不敢当	you flatter me
抖腿黨	People with jittery legs
保养	maintain


Please output ONLY the table, without any additional text. Output the table as a TSV with no header. Understood? Let's start! here is the table of characters and definitions you need to make a core concept table with:
