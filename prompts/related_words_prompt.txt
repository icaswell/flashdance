You are an excellent Chinese teacher. You will be provided with a list of Chinese words and their synonyms. Please compare and explain the differences between them, for example in which context one can be used vs the other, and subtle differences in meaning. Please output in CSV format. Here is a table with several examples:

word,synonym(s),explanation of differences
安排,整理,"安排 (ānpái)
Generally means to arrange or plan things systematically, often involving scheduling or organizing events, tasks, or activities.

整理 (zhěnglǐ)
Means to tidy up, organize, or sort things out, focusing on putting things in order or arranging them in a neat manner.

As an example, if you're talking about cleaning up things in your room, you could use 整理 (zhěnglǐ), but it wouldn't make sense to say 安排 (ānpái). On the other hand, if you're organizing the events for someone's birthday, you could only use 安排 (ānpái)."
老公,丈夫;先生,"There are three words for husband: 丈夫 (zhàngfu), 先生 (xiānsheng), and 老公 (lǎogong). All three mean husband, the only difference is the level of formality. Here are the details:

老公 (lǎogong)
This is a casual, informal word for husband. The corresponding word for wife is 老婆 (lǎopó) 

丈夫 (zhàngfu)
This is a formal word, and is also used in legal contexts. The corresponding word for wife is 妻子 (qīzi).

先生 (xiānsheng)
This is the most formal of all. The corresponding word for wife is 太太 (tàitai).

For example, if you are telling a friend that your husband loves cats, you would probably use 老公 (lǎogong), or possibly 丈夫 (zhàngfu) if you are speaking formally, but you would never use 先生 (xiānsheng). However, if you are watching a C-Drama, and a cultivator is formally telling the court that Lán Zhàn's husband loves rabbits, they might use 先生 (xiānsheng)."
爱情,爱;喜欢,"爱 (ài)
General term for love, applicable in various contexts, including romantic, familial, or platonic love.

喜欢 (xǐhuān)
More casual, expressing liking or fondness; used in various relationships, such as friendships or preferences.

爱情 (àiqíng)
Specifically refers to romantic love or the emotion of love in a romantic relationship.

For example, you could use 喜欢 (xǐhuān) to say that you like your boss, like your cat, or like your spouse. You could say that you love your cat or your spouse with 爱 (ài), but you probably wouldn't say this about your boss. And you could say you have romantic love, or 爱情 (àiqíng), for your spouse, but definitely not for your cat or your boss!"
打算,计划,"The words 打算 (dǎsuàn) and 计划 (jìhuà) are both verbs meaning ""to plan"", but they differ in the level of detailedness they express.

打算 (dǎsuàn)
This refers to a more general idea, not a detailed plan.

计划 (jìhuà)
This is a detailed plan of what specifically you want to do, specifically for bigger or more complex things.

Therefore, if someone asks you what you are going to do on the weekend and you say planning to relax, you might say ""我打算放松“, but if you are talking about what things you are planning to do at your wedding, you would express it with 计划 (jìhuà)!"
开心,高兴;快乐;愉快;愉悦;幸福,"There are many different ways to talk about being happy or unhappy in Chinese. Of these, 开心 (kāixīn) and 高兴 (gāoxìng) are the most common and general, and the others have more specific meanings.

开心 (kāixīn)
This is the most commonly used term. It is pretty much equivalent to ""happy"" in English.

高兴 (gāoxìng)
This is almost the same meaning as 开心, but 不高兴 carries more of a connotation of being angry than being unhappy.

幸福 (xìngfú)
This refers to a very deep, stable, sense of happiness, typically lasting a long time.

快乐 (kuàilè)
This word can only really be used in expressions like ""Happy New Year""/""Happy Birthday""/""Happy Christmas"" etc.

愉快 (yúkuài)
This is really not very different from 快乐, but it is used for things that are smaller in scale, like ""happy weekend"", ""happy journey"" etc.

愉悦 (yúyuè)
Similar to 愉快, expressing a pleasant and delightful feeling, but less commonly used.

Let's clarify this with some examples! If you are saying you are feeling happy right now, 开心 (kāixīn) or 高兴 (gāoxìng) are the right ones to use. But if you have a happy marriage, that's a deep or lasting feeling, so you'll want to say it is 幸福 (xìngfú). If you're wishing someone a good trip, you'd use 愉快 (yúkuài); but if you're wishing them a happy new year, that's big enough that you'd use 快乐 (kuàilè)."
忽然,突然,"There is really very little difference between 忽然 (hūrán) and 突然 (túrán), and they can be regarded as synonyms. The only difference of note is that only 突然 can be used as an adjective (meaning ""sudden""), whereas 忽然 is only an adverb."
频繁,不时;经常;时常;往往,"频繁 (pínfán), 经常 (jīngcháng) and 时常 (shícháng)
These three words all mean ""often"" or ""frequently"". They are synonyms and have no real difference in meaning.

往往 (wǎngwǎng)
Thsi word is similar to 频繁, 经常, and 时常, but the meaning is closer to ""usually"" than ""often"".

不时 (bùshí)
This word means ""from time to time"", and therefore has a quite different meaning from the above.

For Example, if you want to say that your cat often meows at you for no reason, you could use any one of 频繁 (pínfán), 经常 (jīngcháng) or 时常 (shícháng). If you want to say that Wei Wuxian is usually flirtatious, you could use 往往 (wǎngwǎng). However, 不时 (bùshí) would substantially change the meaning of both of these statements."
