历史 is typically translated as "history," but it can also encompass the meaning of "past" in certain contexts.

对方
Aside from its general meaning of "the other party/person," 对方 is commonly used in formal settings like negotiations or legal discussions.  In casual conversation, it can sound a bit stiff. More colloquial alternatives include 他们 (tāmen) if you know the other party is plural, or the person's name or title if known.  For example, instead of asking "What does the other party think?" (对方怎么想？), it would sound more natural in everyday speech to ask "What do they think?" (他们怎么想？) or "What does Mr. Li think?" (李先生怎么想？).

牛 (niú, awesome)
牛 (niú) meaning "awesome" is very colloquial.  It's common in online slang and informal speech among younger generations. Using it in formal situations would be inappropriate.  A more formal equivalent would be  厉害 (lìhai).  牛逼 (niúbī) is even more slangy than 牛 and carries a more boastful tone.  It's generally considered impolite in formal contexts.

奖励
While 奖励 (jiǎnglì) can generally translate to "reward," it often carries a more formal or official connotation than the English word. It implies a reward given by an organization or authority figure for achievement or good behavior. In casual contexts, a more appropriate word might be something like "请客" (qǐngkè - treat someone) or just "给" (gěi - give).

兄长 (xiōngzhǎng)
兄长 specifically refers to older brothers, and has a very formal feel to it. In modern Chinese, it is more common to just say 哥哥 (gēge) for "older brother."

~
贪钱 (tānqián)
贪钱 (tānqián) is quite a strong and negative term. While it can be translated as "greedy for money," it often carries a moral judgment, implying a selfish and excessive desire for wealth.  More neutral terms to describe someone focused on financial gain include  看重钱 (kànzhòng qián) or 重视金钱 (zhòngshì jīnqián).

台湾
Be mindful of the political sensitivities surrounding the term 台湾 (Táiwān). While commonly translated as "Taiwan," its usage and interpretation can vary depending on the political context.  It is usually considered politically correct to call it "Taiwan, China" (中国台湾).

More general terms for cultivating include  种植 (zhòngzhí - for plants) or  培养 (péiyǎng - for skills/talent).
