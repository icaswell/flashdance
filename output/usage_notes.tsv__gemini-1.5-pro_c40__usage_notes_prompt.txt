线
线 (xiàn) has numerous meanings related to long, thin objects or connections. Be mindful of its context-dependent interpretations.  When referring to physical objects like thread, string, or wire, 线 emphasizes their thin, flexible nature.  When referring to lines, routes, or connections, it implies a path or channel.  As a classifier, it is used for things that are long, thin and flexible, such as a ray of light or a stream of water. It's crucial to pay attention to the surrounding words to determine the precise meaning of 线 in a given sentence. Additionally, the "tier" ranking of Chinese cities is colloquial and not an official designation.
