This appears to be an attempt to translate the English idiom "to sit in judgment of someone" using the word 叛徒 (traitor). This is incorrect.  "To sit in judgment of someone" does not mean that the person is literally sitting and they are a traitor. There is no single perfect equivalent in Chinese, but phrases like  对…评头论足 (duì... píngtóulùnzú - to nitpick and criticize someone),  指责 (zhǐzé - to accuse/criticize), or  妄加评论 (wàngjiā pínglùn - to make unwarranted comments) could convey similar meanings depending on the context.
