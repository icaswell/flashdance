The Dao that can be spoken of is not the ever-constant Dao.
The name that can be named is not the ever-constant name.
That which is without-name is the beginning of heaven and
      earth.
That which possesses a name is the mother of the ten
      thousand creatures.
 
Therefore : always without-desire, thus you observe its
      subtle mystery.
Always possessing desires, thus you observe its external
      appearances.
These two, they arise from the same source but have
      different names;
This sameness is called their deep mystery.
 
Deep mysteries, and again deep mysteries –

Notes :

            Being is named as the mother of the ten thousand

In the world, when all know that the action of beauty is
      beautiful, then ugliness ensues.
When all know that the action of good is goodness, then
      not-good ensues.                   
 
Therefore : being and non-being create each other,
Difficult and easy complete each other,
Long and short contrast each other,
High and low lean on each other,
Tone and voice harmonize each other,
Before and after follow each other.
 
Thus the sage :
Lives by using non-action in his duties,
And practicing no-talking in his teachings.
 
The ten thousand creatures arise, but do not have a
      beginning.
Creating but not possessing;
Acting, but not concerned with the results;
Accomplishing tasks, but not dwelling on them.         
 
Now : only because there is no dwelling,
Thus the results do not depart.

C : compare to #39, where low is the foundation of high
D : this line is missing in the earliest three sources; there is no indication in the original Chinese as to whether it is the sage or the creatures that are the ones acting in this and the following lines, so it is left ambiguous here as well

Notes
A : while the symbol used here only appears in one out of four sources, it gives the most straightforward translation;

B : this line could just as likely be translated as

Notes

Heaven is eternal, earth is enduring.                           
The reason that heaven and earth can be eternal and
      enduring
Is because they do not live for themselves.
Therefore they can live forever.         
 
Thus the sage :
Puts his self behind others, yet finds his self before them.
Considers his self extraneous, yet his self survives.
 
Is this not because he has no self-interests?
Therefore he can achieve his self-interests.
♦Heaven is eternal, earth is enduring.                                                                            [forever] [for a long time]

♦Therefore he can achieve his self-interests.       [selfish]
Notes
A : while this translation is more consistent with the sentiments that follow it, an equally possible translation is
     Is because they do not give themselves life
B : presumably meaning leading them; this line and the next are written in this awkward manner to emphasize that it is the personality or sense-of-self that is being talked about (in the translator’s opinion – see the Introduction and cross-references below)

The highest virtue is like water –
Water’s virtue benefits the ten thousand creatures, yet it
      does not strive.
It dwells in places that everyone detests,
Therefore it is almost comparable to Dao!
 
In dwelling, the virtue is in the land.
In your heart/mind, the virtue is in being profound and
      deep.
In relations, the virtue is in being kind.
In speech, the virtue is in being truthful.
In governing, the virtue is in being honest and just.
In your duties, the virtue is in being competent.
In action, the virtue is in the timing.

The five colors can make people’s eyes blind.

The five flavors can make people’s mouths dull.
Excessive hunting and horse racing can make people’s
      heart/minds become wild.  
Rare goods can make people’s behavior corrupt.       
 
Thus the sage :
Acts on what is inside, he does not act on what he sees.
Therefore he leaves that and chooses this.

Favor and disgrace seem alarming.
High rank brings great suffering if you have a self.
 
What is meant by “favor and disgrace seem alarming”?
Favor makes you the inferior, so gaining it seems alarming.
Losing it also seems alarming.
This is what is meant by “favor and disgrace seem
      alarming”.
 
What is meant by “high rank brings great suffering if you
      have a self”?
I am the reason that I have great suffering, I who act like
      I have a self.
When I am without a self, how could I have suffering?
 
Therefore : he who is high ranking and uses his self to
      serve the world –
It seems he can thus be entrusted with the world!
He who is loving and uses his self to serve the world –
It seems he can thus be entrusted with the world!

Notes
A : Ames&Hall point out that “favor” here means something that is bestowed upon you by a superior at their whim, thus it emphasizes your inferiority to them; and since it could be taken away just as easily, merely gaining it is cause for “alarm” (worry, anxiety, etc.)
B : this is written in this awkward manner to emphasize that it is the personality or sense-of-self that is being talked about (in the translator’s opinion – see the Introduction and cross-references below)

The virtue of the ancients made they who were scholars

Their mysterious depths can not be understood.
 
Now : only because they can not be understood,
Therefore we try to emulate their appearance :
Hesitant!, as if crossing a winter stream.
Wary!, as if afraid of their neighbors all around.        
Respectful!, they are like a visiting guest.
Yielding!, like ice that is about to to break off.
Honest and genuine!, they are like the uncarved block.
Wide and open!, they are like a valley.
Unclear!, they are like muddy water.
 
Who can take muddy water and use stillness to slowly and
      gently make it pure and clear?
Who can take what is tranquil and use continual movement
      to slowly and gently bring it to life?
 
He who maintains this Way does not desire to be full.
Now : only because he is not full,
Thus he can be hidden and unfinished.

Notes
The last two lines are not present in GUO

B : apparently referring to a purity and clarity of the heart/mind

Notes
A :  太 上 literally means “highest superior”, which is also a euphemism for the emperor (and so is extrapolated to rulers in general)
B : in other words, he does not offer them lightly or often; this line is very difficult to translate, because WB uses a unique first symbol, while HSG&FY and GUO&MWD/B each use different symbols; however, the two earlier symbols can both mean “to scheme”, thus making a 4/5 majority in meaning; the rest of the sentence is so terse that it can be translated in numerous ways as well
C : under the proper rulership, everyone thinks everything just naturally works out right

Notes
By looking at all the sources, it is easy to see that this chapter grew more anti-Confucian over time!
A : the MWD texts use “knowledge” (a non-Confucian term) instead of “wisdom”; this whole sentence is absent in GUO
B : this symbol could also be interpreted as hypocrisy, pretense, lying, dishonesty, etc.
C : the six relationships refer to “all” the possible kinds of relationship in a family (in ancient China) : husband to wife, wife to husband, father to son, son to father, older brother to younger brother, younger brother to older brother

Notes
GUO is significantly different about what to renounce or abandon, and the results, and it uses no Confucian terms; as early as MWD/B and MWD/A some Confucian terms had appeared
A : perhaps meaning a place worth belonging to?

Notes
This chapter seems to be the sage-like author poking fun at himself, describing how he appears to ordinary people who don’t understand him; the “very’s” scattered throughout the chapter are implied by repeated symbols; only the first 6 lines are present in GUO
A : many people over the centuries have suggested that this line should be the last in #19 for many good reasons; however, there is an explicit end-of-chapter marker in GUO at the end of #19 (which is not even followed by #20 in its  manuscript), so this line does indeed seem to belong here
B : formal versus informal, respectively
C : according to Lau, the Tai Lao sacrifice was a major feast where sheep, pigs, and ox were ritually sacrificed and eaten
D : in ancient China, terraces were man-made hills with paths cut into in their sides, leading up to a plateau at the top from which to view the surrounding landscape
E : only WB changed “seem” to “confused”, thus making “very confused”, keeping with all the other “very’s”
F : “drift” comes from HSG and FY (while they use different symbols, they have the same meaning, thus making a majority); the symbol in WB means “wind”, and so is incorporated into the added phrase; the “I” is added at the beginning to maintain the I/they alternation

Notes
A : compare to #14, where something (presumably Dao) is also indistinct and confusing, and to #40, where Dao specifically “returns” and “weakens”
B : “this” could be referring to observing the action of Dao, or just observing the world in front of you, or to the teachings of the DDJ, or something else – you decide!

Serious serves as the source of frivolous.
Stillness serves as the ruler of restlessness.
Thus the noble man travels the entire day,
And does not stray from his wagon.
He is serious, even though glorious sights and feasts exist;
He lives above them, like this.
So how could one be the master of ten thousand chariots,
And conduct his self frivolously in the world?    
 
Be frivolous, then lose the source.
Be restless, then lose the rulership.
♦Serious{heavy} serves as the source of frivolous{light}.

♦Be restless, then lose the rulership.
Notes
A : this symbol also means impatience, agitation, anxiety, etc; “stillness” and “restlessness” are presumably referring to inner, mental/emotional qualities
B : Only WB and HSG changed “noble man” to the non-Confucian term “sage”
C : traditionally, the first symbol of this sentence is considered to be the last symbol of the previous sentence (“heavy wagon”); but because the MWD’s have “fields” instead of “wagon” at the end of the previous sentence, and “heavy fields” makes no sense, it is parsed this way
D : presumably, by being serious and still
E : someone very important, such as the supreme ruler of a large nation (one with 10,000 chariots)
F : this is written in this awkward manner to emphasize that it is the personality or sense-of-self that is being talked about (in the translator’s opinion – see the Introduction and cross-references below)

Notes
A : this could possibly be interpreted by reflection with “glory” as “humbleness” or “humility”, but it means “disgrace” everywhere else
B : by using “it”, this refers to the concept of the uncarved block; but the symbol also means “them”, which would refer to the tools
C : when the uncarved block is cut, it becomes (merely) tools; when the sage cuts, things are not divided up (see #58)

Would you take hold of the world and control it?           
I see you have no choice.
 
Now : the world is a divine vessel,
You can not control it (indeed!).
He who acts, ruins it;
He who grasps, loses it.
 
Therefore : creatures are
Sometimes active, sometimes passive,
Sometimes breathe heavy, sometimes breathe easy,
Sometimes strong, sometimes weak,
Sometimes oppressed, sometimes overthrown.
 
Thus the sage :
Removes the extremes,
Removes the extravagant and wasteful,
Removes the arrogance.

A : every source uses a different symbol here!

“exhale … blow”, “flatter … brag”, “breathe silently … breathe loudly”
C : other than WB and HSG, every source has a different pair in this line!

Notes
The first three lines are not in GUO
A : WB and HSG’s use of “indifferent” seems the most neutral, but the three earliest sources technically have the majority with “reverent”, while FY has “peaceful”
B : this line comes from the MWD’s and GUO; the later sources are very different (and do not agree with each other); regardless of the source, this line and the next can be translated many different ways due to the multiple meanings of 美 (“pleased”, “beautiful”, “good”), and whether or not one assumes that weapons are still being talked about
C : Ames and Hall point out that ancient Chinese custom puts the place of honor on the left in happy events, and on the right in sorrowful events; thus in war, the supreme general sits on the right, acknowledging that war is a sorrowful event, just like a funeral

Dao is ever-constantly without-name.
 
Even though the concept of the uncarved block seems

No one in the world can conquer it.
If nobles and kings could maintain it,
The ten thousand creatures would naturally obey.
Heaven and earth would join with each other,
Thus dropping a sweet dew.
There are no citizens who would make this happen,
Yet it would be naturally fair and impartial.
 
And so, begin to divide and you have names.
Once names exist,
Men should also be ready to know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop is the reason that there is no danger.

Notes
A : while this symbol does literally mean “nobles”, it also specifically refers to a “Marquis”; the Western equivalents for the five grades of Chinese nobility (below the royal family) were Duke,  Marquis, Count (or Earl), Viscount, and Baron, in descending order
B : Waley comments that this phrase is used to indicate that the kingdom is at peace

Notes
A : possibly meaning one’s center, source or root (but then why not use one of the many symbols used elsewhere for these words?), this may be referring to one’s station or position in life (ancient Chinese society was highly stratified); but on the other hand, that sounds very Confucian – so you decide!
B : this line has generated much speculation over the millennia; perhaps it refers to being remembered after you die, or the death of the “self”?

Great Dao is like a vast flood!
It is able to flow left and right.
 
The ten thousand creatures depend on it in order for life,
And are not rejected.
It accomplishes its tasks successfully,
Yet does not possess a name.
It clothes and supports the ten thousand creatures,
But does not act as their master.
 
Therefore : since it is ever-constantly without-desire,
It can then be named insignificant.
 
Since the ten thousand creatures return to it
But it does not act as their master,
It can then be named great.
 
Thus the sage can achieve greatness   
Because he does not act great.
Therefore he can achieve greatness.

Notes
A : in other words, everywhere
B : the last three lines are significantly different between sources.  What is used here comes from the MWD’s, and FY says the exact same thing with slightly different symbols (thus making it the majority).  But HSG reads
      Thus2 the sage2 is whole, but does not act great.
      Therefore he can achieve his greatness.
And WB reads (with no reference to the sage, presumably still referring to Dao from earlier in the chapter)
      Because it is whole, it naturally does not act great.
      Therefore it can achieve its greatness.
WB also switched from saying the sage is great to Dao is great in #67

Notes
A : “doing” could just as easily be used here, but since the sage is the one who does no harm in #58, #60, and #66, “meeting with” is used
B : the sentence-as-a-whole can be interpreted in two different ways (see the Introduction) : “speaking about Dao” or “the words that come out of Dao” (which is used here); also note that in the majority of the sources this line is a statement, not a question

Dao ever-constantly practices non-action,
Yet nothing is left undone.

A man of highest De does not use his De, thus he
      possesses De.
A man of inferior De does not lose his De, thus he is
      without De.
 
A man of highest De uses non-action, and acts without
      motive.                                 
A man of inferior De coerces others, and has a motive to
      act.
A man of highest kindness coerces others, and acts
      without motive.       
A man of highest morality coerces others, and has a
      motive to act.
A man of highest propriety coerces others, and if there
      is no one who responds,
Then he rolls up his sleeves and keeps doing it.
 
Therefore : lose Dao, and later comes De.
Lose De, and later comes kindness.
Lose kindness, and later comes morality.
Lose morality, and later comes propriety.
Now : propriety is that which is merely the appearance of
      loyalty and honesty,
And the beginning of confusion.
 
He who is ahead in knowledge has the flower of Dao,
But the beginning of stupidity and foolishness.
 
Thus the greatest elders :
Live by Dao’s substance, and do not dwell on Dao’s
      appearance.
Live on Dao’s fruit, and do not dwell on Dao’s flower.
Therefore they leave that and choose this.

Notes
This chapter is anti-Confucian as early as MWD/B!
A : he does not lose De in that he is always trying to show that he has De
B : “coerces” is the same symbol as “acts”, but is used here to emphasize that it is the opposite of “non-action”
C : this line varies greatly between all the sources, and there is no majority; this comes from FY as it seems to make the most sense
D : this could also mean “future knowledge” and so is often translated as “foreknowledge”, “prescience”, etc.
E : fruit provides nourishment, whereas a flower is merely showy
F : compare to #50 and #75, where living for the “substance” is apparently a bad thing
G : presumably, appearance and the “flower” vs. substance and the “fruit” (respectively)

Of those who in ancient times attained oneness :
Heaven attained oneness, thus becoming pure and clear.
Earth attained oneness, thus becoming stable.
Spirit attained oneness, thus becoming potent.
The valley attained oneness, thus becoming full.
The ten thousand creatures attained oneness, thus
      becoming alive.
Nobles and kings attained oneness, thus serving the world
      faithfully.
They attained it.
 
If heaven could not use its purity and clarity,
I fear it would split apart.
If earth could not use its stability,
I fear it would erupt.
If spirit could not use its potency,
I fear it would cease to be.
If the valley could not use its fullness,
I fear it would be used up.
If the ten thousand creatures could not use their life,
I fear they would be destroyed.
If nobles and kings could not use their high rank and
      prominence,
I fear they would fall.
 
Therefore : humility thus serves as the source of high rank;
Low thus serves as the foundation of high.
Thus nobles and kings call themselves orphaned, lonely,
        and unlucky.
Does this not mean that humility thus serves as the source?
Does it not?
 
Therefore : to attain exceptional popularity is to be without
      popularity –
Do not desire to be scarce like jade,
But common like rock.

The movement of Dao returns things.
The function of Dao is to weaken things.
 
The ten thousand creatures of the world are created from
      being;
Being is created from non-being.

Notes
A : all creatures grow weaker as they age, and all man-made things decay and fall apart, which is the way (Dao) of the universe; this is why in #30 and #55 creatures which are old but still robust are “not Dao”; compare these first two lines to #14 and #21, where Dao’s action is indistinct and confusing
B : technically, the majority of the sources read “The creatures of the world…” but “ten thousand creatures” is such a standard saying everywhere else that it is retained here from the other sources
C : compare to #42, where creatures are created by “three”
D : compare to #2, where non-being and being create each other

The superior scholar hearing of Dao works hard and

The inferior scholar hearing of Dao laughs greatly at it.
If he did not laugh, it would not be qualified to be Dao.
 
Therefore : in the established sayings that exist, it is said –
Insight into Dao seems like darkness.
Advancing in Dao seems like retreating.
Smooth Dao seems knotted.
Superior De seems like a valley.
The greatest purity seems like disgrace.

Notes
A : Ames&Hall comment that it is unknown whether “established sayings” is referring to proverbs in general, or a specific work that no longer exists
B : compare to #53, where “Dao is extremely even”
C : this line could just as likely be translated as
            The greatest square is without corners
but considering that the DDJ often refers to nations, this translation seems more appropriate
D : a euphemism for “great talents mature slowly”
E : although this line only survives in MWD/B of the three earlier sources, it is used here because it is much more straightforward and understandable than the later three

When the world possesses Dao,
Riding horses are nonetheless used for manure.
When the world is without Dao,
War-horses are bred in the countryside.                                             
 
There is no fault greater than the capacity for desire.
There is no misfortune greater than not knowing when
      you have enough.
There is no error greater than desire for gain.
 
Therefore : knowing the sufficiency of having enough,
      there is always enough!

Notes
A : this line is in every source except WB
B : The core of this sentence is “足 of 足 always 足”, where 足 can mean “enough”, “sufficient”, or possibly “satisfaction” (and by interpretation, “contentment”), so it can be translated in many ways; while I usually use the same English word for each symbol (when appropriate), in this case it seems clearer to use different words with equivalent meanings within the same sentence; this would be similar to changing the phrase “appears to have appeared” to “seems to have appeared”

Notes
A : compare to #50, which refers to one who “takes in life”; “gathering” is used for consistency with #36; the repeated symbol implies “very”, hence completeness
B : this line can be translated in many ways, mainly due to the fact that the symbol for “merges” can also mean “muddled” or “whole”; also 其 (his/their) could be referring to the sage or to the 100 families; the choices made here are consistent with the first two lines of the chapter
C : compare to #12, where the sage does not act on what he sees
D : adding “his” turns this line from something deragatory (“treats them all like children”, which seems out of character) into something that matches #42, where the sage becomes an “elder teacher” (literally, godfather)

Notes
A : “follower” as in disciple or one who agrees with a particular way of looking at things
B : this phrase can also be interpreted as “13”, possibly referring to the 4 limbs and 9 openings of the human body, but when using “3 in 10” then the first five lines discuss 9 out of 10 people, and the remaining lines seem to talk about the tenth (presumably sage-like) person
C : there are many different interpretations of this phrase (and the entire sentence); presumably, the “place of death” is the end destination of the journey of life as opposed to a literal location (a more modern interpretation of the symbols is the “point of death”); while the symbols for this sentence come from WB and HSG and are technically a minority, the phrasing they use here matches that in the third line following
D : compare to #38, where living for the “substance” is apparently a good thing, and #75, where it is a bad thing
E : compare to #49, where the sage “gathers in the world”; the last part of this sentence could also be translated as “he who has virtue and takes in life”

C : while the common meaning of this symbol is “observe” (as used elsewhere), here it is taken to mean to contemplate or meditate upon, with the connotation of examining a concept in order to see things as they really are
D : “this” could be referring to contemplating the previous things, or just observing the world in front of you, or to the teachings of the DDJ, or to something else – you decide!

He who embodies the substance of De
Can be compared to a newborn child :
Wasps, scorpions, snakes, and serpents do not sting him,
Fierce beasts do not seize him,
Birds of prey do not claw him.                                   
His bones are weak, his muscles are soft, yet his grasp is
      firm and strong.
He has not yet known the union of female and male, yet his
      penis rises.
He has the utmost essence, indeed!
He cries the entire day yet does not get hoarse.
He has the utmost harmony, indeed!
 
Knowing harmony speaks of the ever-constant.
Knowing the ever-constant speaks of insight.
Benefitting life speaks of good fortune.
Heart/mind making Qi speaks of strength.
 
When creatures are robust but old,
We call them “not Dao”.
That which is “not Dao” has an early finish.

Notes
The very’s in the first four lines are implied by the repeated symbols at the end of each line
A : every source has a different symbol here; this comes from WB
B : this line and the next can be translated many ways because of the numerous meanings of their last symbols (see the Introduction) – the translation given here is the most “neutral”, saying only that they depend on each other
C : literally “their extremes”, presumably in the sense of “to what extremes they will go” or “how far will they go”; compare to #59
D : this symbol also has the sense of “morally upright”, “principled”, and “ethical”
E : compare to #28 where the “greatest cutting does not divide” (also in relation to the sage)
F : every source has a different symbol, but three of them mean “to shine, dazzle, be glorious” thus making a majority in meaning; compare to how the sage does not “display” in #22, #47, #72, #77

Governing a great nation is like cooking a small fish.

Notes
A : compare this line to the first two lines of the previous chapter and it is easy to see why there has long been speculation that this line should end the previous chapter; however, there is an explicit end-of-chapter marker in GUO #59, and GUO does not even contain this chapter; essentially this line is saying it is easy to ruin a small fish by overcooking, and it is easy to ruin a nation by over-controlling
B : first – the “it” is literal, presumably meaning “the world’s ghosts”; second – “ghosts” is the most literal, general term, but this could also be referring to demons (or possibly to souls of the ancestors); third – “spirit” might be better thought of in this chapter as “spiritual power”, thus this line seems to be saying that ghosts do not have any power in the world; this and the next few lines can be translated in many different ways, due to the multiple meanings of the symbols for “ghost” and “spirit”, and the lack of any reasonable context – perhaps these lines were addressing some lost ancient scholarly debate or common cultural belief?

A great nation is like the lowest places water can flow –

The female always uses stillness to conquer the male.
By using stillness, she becomes lower-than.

Then it is taken hold of by the great nation.
 
Therefore : sometimes one nation is lower-than in order

That is not as good as sitting and offering this Way.
♦What was the ancient ’s reason that2 they valued this
      Way?
Did they not say :
Seek in order to obtain,
Have faults in order to be forgiven ?  [exempt,spare,excuse]
♦Therefore [Dao]G becomes valuable to the world2.
 
 
Notes
A : although they are in the minority, I rather like what the MWD’s say :
            That which Daos is the flowing together of the
            ten thousand creatures
B : presumably, for bartering
C : these two symbols could just as likely be translated as “honorable deeds”
D: the “son of heaven” is a standard phrase referring to the emperor
E : specifically Dukes (see #32), but in keeping with other chapters, this is interpreted more generally as “nobles”; the phrase “three Dukes” specifically refers to the highest state officials, advisors, or ministers
F : a very expensive and impressive offering, indeed!
G : there is no subject in the original Chinese; Dao is assumed based on the 4th line previous

Notes
Only the first four sentences and the last three are in GUO.
A : this line could also be translated as
            Taste without tasting
or
            Taste by non-tasting
but it is phrased this way because of the reference in #35 about how Dao’s words are “without flavor” (using the same two symbols in both chapters)
B : this line literally reads “too many easy certainly
too many difficult” but is worded in this way due to the lines that precede and follow it

The virtue of the ancients (they who acted in Dao),
Did not use it to enlighten the citizens,
But would have used it to keep them ignorant –
The citizens are hard to govern
Because they have too much knowledge.
 
Therefore : using knowledge to govern the nation
Is the bane of the nation.
Not using knowledge to govern the nation
Is the good fortune of the nation.
He who has knowledge of these two also has them as
      examples.
 
To always understand these examples –
This is called deep and mysterious De.
Deep and mysterious De is so profound! and remote!
That when creatures return, it returns with them!
Then they reach the greatest harmony.

In desiring to be above the citizens,
He must by means of his speech be lower-than them.
In desiring to be before the citizens,
He must by means of his self be behind them.

Notes
A : this may sound egotistical, but the sage is described as being “great” in #34 and #63 and “valued” in #70; only WB and HSG changed this and the next four lines to read
            In the world2, all say my Dao is great,
            And does not seem to be like [anything else].
            Now : only [because it is] great, therefore it does
                  not seem to be like [anything else].
            If [it was] like [anything else],
            Long ago ! it would have become insignificant,
                  indeed!
WB also switched from saying the sage is great to Dao is great in #34; also note that here it is everyone else, not the sage, who says the sage is great
B : see #20 for many examples of how the sage is not like everyone else; this and the next three lines are translated in many different ways because 肖 (“seem”, “resemble”) sounds the same as a different symbol meaning “small” and so is sometimes interpreted that way, and because 不 肖 can also mean “unworthy”
C : this sentence comes from MWD/B for consistency with the previous lines
D : presumably take the lead, rule, etc.; compare to #7 and #66 about being behind to be first
E : this could be referring to expanding your territory or kingdom

A : 寸 was a unit of length, very close to one inch
B : 尺 was a unit of length, very close to one foot
C : this symbol is definitely referring to the limb, not the English synonym for “weapons”; this and the next two lines can be translated in many ways due to their terseness
D : as in “hold the fort” or “maintain your position”
E : there is a great deal of variation between the sources for this line and the next, so WB and HSG are taken as the “standard”; each later source made changes to try to turn it into something that made sense!
F : presumably, mourning the need to fight and/or the death it involves; compare to #31, where war is compared to dwelling at a funeral

Notes
A : “My” is inferred here from the first line, but could just as reasonably be left out, or “All” substituted
B : there is no subject in the original Chinese, so this could also be saying “only because [the previous two lines] is not understood”, but because 無 知 (without-knowledge) is specifically used, it is translated in this way

“Sickness” here presumably refers to the suffering that comes from not following Dao

Notes
A : possibly meaning someone else will take over, either from within or without?
B : these two symbols could also be translated as “place of birth” or even “parents” (they who gave them life)
C : this seems to be something of a play on words, because the symbol for “despise” in the previous line is the same symbol for “tire of”, so this line could also be translated as
            Thus2 they will not despise you
but “tire of” is used here because of #66, where the citizens do not tire of the sage’s rule

Notes
There are two themes in this chapter which do not seem to fit in with typical Daoist concepts – that of heaven conquering (literally “victory” or “beat”, interpreted as “achieving its goals”) which sounds more like striving than non-action, and planning (interpreted as “prepares”) which seems contradictory to being “naturally so” (although the sage also “plans” here and in #63)
A : in early societies, whatever endeavors failed were by definition what heaven (or the gods) “detested”
B : this sentence only appears in the later sources, and seems to be a parenthetical comment; although it technically is in the majority, it seems so out-of-place that it is left out of the final translation above
C : this sentence is nearly impossible to translate; while the first symbol in WB and HSG are the same, making them the default “majority”, it is different in every other source, and none of their modern translations make sense; some translators use a symbol slightly different than that in WB and HSG but pronounced the same way; finally, “slow, patient, calm” is only the most likely translation that could be found for the first symbol
D : “extremely” is implied by the repeated symbol

The people are born (indeed!) soft and weak.

Notes
A : “follower” as in disciple or one who agrees with a particular way of looking at things
B : an inflexible weapon shatters easily; this line can be translated in many ways, because “weapon is inflexible” can also mean
            weapon is strong
            army is inflexible
            army is strong
C : interestingly, this is the same symbol translated in #61, #66, and #68 as “lower-than” (which was a good thing), so in this case it is the inferior qualities which are lower-than

Notes
The point of the beginning of this chapter seems to be that the sage does not create resentments in the first place
A : Lau says that the left side of a contract or agreement was the creditor’s side, so the sage is the one who is owed
B : Hatcher points out that while the Way of heaven itself is without favor, virtuous people have aligned themselves with it (because of their virtue), hence it is “with” them

Notes
A : the symbol literally refers only to tools, but has been associated with weapons in #31, #36, and #57 : “sharp tools”, “weapons are not the tools of a noble man”
B : the symbol specifically refers to a Count (see #32), but in keeping with other chapters, this is interpreted more generally as “nobles”; the entire phrase probably means “as many weapons as the armies of ten Counts would have”
C : have no need to use them; in other words, they do not want to leave, as supported by the last paragraph
D : compare to #36, where the sharp tools of the nation cannot be shown to the people
E : according to Ames&Hall, knotted ropes used to be used for record-keeping

Appendix – Different Layers of the Dao De Jing
 
While translating the DDJ, I discovered John Emerson’s articles on the possibility of various “layers” within it, based on the presence or absence of certain symbols and “themes” in each chapter.  While he was not the first to suggest the presence of multiple layers, of particular interest to me was his comment : “Many of the objections to my method seemed to be objections to the kinds of rough, empirical, non-algorithmic methods best used to disentangle historically confused material.”  Having a background in something called pattern recognition, I decided to find out whether or not each chapter could be classified as belonging to these layers based on this purely analytical method.
 
Emerson tentatively identified Early, Middle, Late, Added (very small) and Post-Guodian layers.  By definition, the Post-Guodian layer contains at least chapters 67-81, none of which appear in the Guodian source.  Building on Emerson’s work, extensive analysis using pattern recognition methods based on the relative frequencies of the symbols in each chapter indicates that the most self-consistent results are obtained when the DDJ is separated into three layers of chapters :
Early : 1 4 5 6 7 9 10 13 14 15 16 20 21 23 24 25 28 30 31 32 34 35 37 39 41 44 51 52 55 56
Late : 3 8 12 17 18 19 22 27 29 38 45 46 47 48 49 53 54 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66
Post-Guodian : 11 26 33 36 40 42 43 50 67-81
Mixed : 2                                                                    
 
Excluding the chapters he identified as Middle (which ended up being assigned very evenly across the other three layers), none of these completely disagree with Emerson’s assignments (except for 52, which is the only entire chapter he considered to be Added), although he assigns some sections of some chapters to other layers.  While a significant majority (85%) of the chapters were strongly identified as belonging to their layer (the underlined chapters above), the pattern recognition process did indicate that a few (most notably chapters 24, 45, 46, 59, and 62, and to a lesser extent 8, 22, 30, 39, 44, and 49) may have elements of more than one layer present within them.
 
Note that while Emerson’s names (Early, Late, Post-Guodian) are kept for convenience, they don’t necessarily have to indicate separation in time – they could perhaps represent different oral traditions, or sayings that originally developed in different regions of China, which combined to form the Dao De Jing we know today.  Also note that the Guodian document (~300 BCE) consists of chapters from both Early and Late in roughly equal numbers, so this “layering” actually happened very early.
 
Although chapter 40 was identified as being strongly Post-Guodian, it is present in the Guodian manuscript, but that is not considered a major problem. For example, if perhaps the post-Guodian “style” was already being developed at the time the Guodian document was created, then the presence of chapter 40 in the document could mean that it had already been written in this style, perhaps shortly before the Guodian document was created, whereas chapters 68-81 had yet to be written (or the Guodian compiler was not aware of their existence).  There are probably many other scenarios that could explain such a result.
 
Chapter 2 was variously classified as belonging to all three layers, but the symbol distributions (below) simultaneously indicated that it cannot belong to any of them!  If any chapter is truly a mixture of layers, it is this one (which Emerson agrees with), so it is not assigned to any.
 
With the chapters separated as given above, it is possible to identify which symbols are used more often in one layer than another, as shown in the table below.  Each line represents one symbol, and shows its various English meanings (as used in this translation).  “Weak” symbols show up three to six times more often in the indicated layer than the other two, while “Strong” symbols show up more than six times more often.  Within these sections, symbols are ordered from the least unbalanced to most unbalanced distributions between the layers.  “Unique” symbols show up only in that layer, and not even once in the others.  In these sections, words are listed from fewest appearances to most appearances.  Weak and Strong symbols must show up in at least five chapters to be included, while Unique symbols must be in at least three chapters.  Phrases (two or more symbols) are shown in italics.  Some punctuation symbols are included as they tend to show differences in grammatical conventions between the layers.  Where two symbols are consistently translated into the same punctuation, (#1) and (#2) are used to distinguish between them.

The symbol for “die, death” that is strongly Post-Guodian is in only one non-Post-Guodian chapter (6, where the “spirit of the valley does not die”).  All of the other 17 times (!) it is used is in Post-Guodian chapters, so if it wasn’t for the one use in chapter 6, this symbol would be strongly unique to the Post-Guodian chapters.
 
Symbols that show up much more often in two layers but rarely in the other one are presented in the table on the following page, in the same format as the previous one.  Symbols in the “Never” sections appear about equally often in the other two layers, but not once in the indicated layer.
 
“Dao” is almost three times more likely to appear in Early and Late than Post-Guodian (and there almost always as “Dao of”), but not quite enough to make it into the following table (under “Rarely in Post-Guodian”).

Besides the symbol distributions, it is interesting to note that of the six chapters in which the majority of the sources are anti-Confucian, all but chapter 33 are Late (and it is Post-Guodian) – thus none of the Early chapters are anti-Confucian.   Also, the anti-military chapters (30, 31) are Early, while the chapters offering military advice (68, 69) are Post-Guodian.   Finally, “living for the substance” is a good thing in chapter 38 (Late), but a bad thing in chapters 50 and 75 (both Post-Guodian).
 
Early chapters are more concerned with heaven and earth, images of the feminine and the child, the concepts of “without-name” and “no danger”, and are the only chapters that try to describe Dao (1, 4, 14, 21, 25, 32, 34, 35), while they have little to do with the sage (only twice using “thus the sage” in 30 chapters), governing the nation, easy vs. difficult, and never mention the concept of “not striving”.
 
Late chapters have more Confucian terms, advice on how to rule, and talk about non-interference, but at the same time are the only ones that talk about possessing or “taking hold of” the world or the nation. 
 
Post-Guodian chapters also offer some advice on how to rule, tend to deal with hard/soft/weak/strong, are the only chapters that offer military advice, and talk a lot about death, but rarely mention Dao or De, and never mention the feminine, the child, emptiness, or the uncarved block.
 
The rest of the appendix collects all the chapters of each layer together, so the reader can see their common themes.  The final section is called “What Would the Sage Do?”, and collects every reference to the Sage from the entire document.

EARLY
 
One
The Dao that can be spoken of is not the ever-constant
      Dao.
The name that can be named is not the ever-constant
      name.
That which is without-name is the beginning of heaven
      and earth.
That which possesses a name is the mother of the ten
      thousand creatures.
 
Therefore : always without-desire, thus you observe its
      subtle mystery.
Always possessing desires, thus you observe its external
      appearances.
These two, they arise from the same source but have
      different names;
This sameness is called their deep mystery.
 
Deep mysteries, and again deep mysteries –
The gateway of many subtle mysteries.
 
 
Four
Dao is like a cup or bowl, yet use it and there exists no
      need to fill it.
Profound and deep!, it appears to be the ancestor of the
      ten thousand creatures.
 
It blunts their sharpness,
Loosens their tangles,
Softens their brightness,
Makes them the same as the dust of the world.
 
Deep and profound!, it seems to barely exist.
I do not know whose child it is –
Its image came before that of god.
 
 
Five
Heaven and earth are not kind –
Thus the ten thousand creatures become as straw dogs to
      them.
The sage is not kind –
Thus the 100 families become as straw dogs to him.
 
The space between heaven and earth,
How is it just like a bellows or flute?
It is empty, yet does not run out.
The more it moves, and the more it produces.
 
Too much talking is exceptionally exhausting,
Which is not as good as maintaining what is within.
 
 
Six
The spirit of the valley does not die –
It is called the deep and mysterious feminine.
 
The gateway of this deep and mysterious feminine – 
It is called the source of heaven and earth.
 
Unbroken, it seems to exist.
Using it takes no effort.
 
 
Seven
Heaven is eternal, earth is enduring.                           
The reason that heaven and earth can be eternal and
      enduring
Is because they do not live for themselves.
Therefore they can live forever.         
 
Thus the sage :
Puts his self behind others, yet finds his self before them.
Considers his self extraneous, yet his self survives.
 
Is this not because he has no self-interests?
Therefore he can achieve his self-interests.
 
 
Nine
Holding and filling it
Are not as good as your stopping short.
 
Hammering and sharpening it
Can not be forever maintained.
 
When gold and jade fill a room,
There is no one who can protect it.
 
To have wealth and high rank, but with arrogance –
Then naturally their loss is your own fault.
 
When the task is successful, the self should let go of it.         
This is the Way of heaven.
 
 
Ten
Carrying and managing a body while embracing the One,
Are you able to not separate them?
Concentrating your Qi to become soft,           
Are you able to be like a newborn infant?
Cleansing and clearing your deep and mysterious
      perception,
Are you able to be without blemish?
Loving the citizens and governing the nation,
Are you able to use non-action?
Opening and closing the gateway of heaven,
Are you able to serve as the feminine?
Attaining clear insight in all directions,                                   
Are you able to not use your knowledge?
 
Creating them and raising them,
Creating but not possessing,
Acting but not concerned with the results,
Leading yet not governing –
This is called deep and mysterious De.
 
 
Thirteen
Favor and disgrace seem alarming.
High rank brings great suffering if you have a self.
 
What is meant by “favor and disgrace seem alarming”?
Favor makes you the inferior, so gaining it seems
      alarming.
Losing it also seems alarming.
This is what is meant by “favor and disgrace seem
      alarming”.
 
What is meant by “high rank brings great suffering if
      you have a self”?
I am the reason that I have great suffering, I who act like
      I have a self.
When I am without a self, how could I have suffering?
 
Therefore : he who is high ranking and uses his self to
      serve the world –
It seems he can thus be entrusted with the world!
He who is loving and uses his self to serve the world –
It seems he can thus be entrusted with the world!
 
 
Fourteen
Look, it is not seen; its name is called elusive.
Listen, it is not heard; its name is called tenuous.
Grasp, it is not gotten; its name is called subtle and
      obscure.
These three things can not be investigated any further –
Therefore they blend and become one.
 
This one thing :
Its highest point is not bright;
Its lowest point is not dark.
Continuous and unending!, it can not be named;
It returns to non-existence.
It is called the form of that which is without-form;
The image of non-existence.
It is called confusing and indistinct.
Meet it and you do not see its beginning;
Follow it and you do not see its end.
 
Hold fast to the Way of the ancients
In order to master the present moment.
The ability to know the ancient beginning –
This is called the main principle of Dao.
 
 
Fifteen
The virtue of the ancients made they who were scholars
      subtle, mysterious, obscure, deep, and penetrating.
Their mysterious depths can not be understood.
 
Now : only because they can not be understood,
Therefore we try to emulate their appearance :
Hesitant!, as if crossing a winter stream.
Wary!, as if afraid of their neighbors all around.        
Respectful!, they are like a visiting guest.
Yielding!, like ice that is about to to break off.
Honest and genuine!, they are like the uncarved block.
Wide and open!, they are like a valley.
Unclear!, they are like muddy water.
 
Who can take muddy water and use stillness to slowly and
      gently make it pure and clear?
Who can take what is tranquil and use continual movement
      to slowly and gently bring it to life?
 
He who maintains this Way does not desire to be full.
Now : only because he is not full,
Thus he can be hidden and unfinished.
 
 
Sixteen
Attain the utmost emptiness.
Maintain a profound stillness.
 
The ten thousand creatures arise in unison,
And thus I observe their return.
Now : all the myriad creatures return to their source.
Returning to the source speaks of stillness.
Stillness is called returning to the natural order.
Returning to the natural order speaks of the
      ever-constant.
 
Knowing the ever-constant speaks of insight.
Not knowing the ever-constant is foolish and creates
      misfortune.
 
Knowing the ever-constant leads to tolerance.
Being tolerant leads to being just and unbiased.
Being just and unbiased leads to being kingly.
Being kingly leads to heaven.
Heaven leads to Dao.
Dao leads to what endures.
 
When the self disappears, there can be no danger.
 
 
Twenty
Renounce learning and be without worry.
 
“Yes” together with “yeah” –
What is their mutual distance or nearness?
Beautiful together with ugliness –
What is their mutual distance or similarity?
 
That which people fear, they are not able to not fear.
How ridiculous! They are not yet centered!
 
Everyone is very festive,
As if enjoying the Tai Lao sacrifice,
As if climbing terraces in the spring.
I alone am unmoved! –
Like one who has not yet given any sign,
Like a newborn infant who does not yet act like a baby.
Very tired and worn out!, as if without a place to return
      to.
 
Everyone all has more than they need;
I alone seem to have lost everything.
I have the heart/mind of a foolish person, indeed!!
I am very mixed up and confused!
 
Common people are very clear and bright;
I alone seem confused.
Common people are very observant and alert;
I alone am very gloomy and depressed.
Tranquil!, they are like the ocean;
I drift on the wind!, as if without a place to rest.
Everyone all has a purpose;
I alone am stupid and stubborn, and appear mean and
      shallow.
I alone am different compared to other people,
And value the food of the mother.
 
 
Twenty one
The greatest De is possible only when Dao is followed.
 
The action of Dao on creatures is just indistinct, just
      confusing.
Confusing! and indistinct!, within it exists image.
Indistinct! and confusing!, within it exists things.
Obscure! and dark!, within it exists essence.
Its essence is extremely real and true.
Within it exists truth.
 
From the present reaching to antiquity,
Its name has not departed –
Thus I observe the father of the multitudes.
How do I thus know the father of the multitudes is like
      this?
By means of this.
 
 
Twenty three
Minimal words are naturally so.
Therefore : strong winds do not last the entire morning,         
Sudden rains do not last the entire day.
 
Who makes these things?  Heaven and earth.
Even heaven and earth can not maintain them forever,
And so how much less can people?
 
Therefore : of those who engage in Dao –
He who Daos is one with Dao.
He who Des is one with De.   
He who loses is one with the loss.
 
For he who is one with Dao,      
Dao is also pleased to have him.         
For he who is one with De,     
De is also pleased to have him.           
For he who is one with loss,   
Loss is also pleased to have him.
 
If you do not trust enough, then you will not have
      anyone’s trust.
 
 
Twenty four
He who stands on tiptoe does not really stand.
He who stands astride can not travel.
He who displays himself does not have insight.
He who considers himself correct does not distinguish
      himself.    
He who boasts about himself is without merit.
He who brags about himself does not endure.
 
He who lives in Dao –
Calls these leftover food and unnecessary behavior.
Creatures detest them, no matter what.
Therefore : he who possesses Dao does not live by them.
 
 
Twenty five
Something existed unformed yet complete,
Before heaven and earth were created.
Silent!  Empty!
Standing alone, not changing.
It circulates everywhere, and causes no danger.
It can be considered the mother of the world.
 
I do not know its name;
Its symbol is called Dao.
If I tried to make its name, I would call it great.
Being great speaks of departing.
Departing speaks of being remote.
Being remote speaks of returning.
 
Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
The king is also great.
Within the realm exist four that are great,
And the king resides as one of them!
 
People follow the earth.
The earth follows heaven.
Heaven follows Dao.
Dao follows what is naturally so.
 
 
Twenty eight
Know your maleness, but maintain your femaleness.
Serve as a stream to the world.   
Serving as a stream to the world,
The ever-constant De will not depart,
Returning you to the state of the newborn infant.
 
Know your brightness, but maintain your darkness.
Serve as an example to the world.
Serving as an example to the world,
The ever-constant De will not falter,
Returning you to the state of the limitless.
 
Know your honor, but maintain your disgrace.
Serve as a valley to the world.
Serving as a valley to the world,
The ever-constant De will then be sufficient,
Returning you to the state of the uncarved block.
 
When the uncarved block is broken up, then it becomes
      tools.
When the sage uses it, then he becomes the senior
      government official.
Therefore : the greatest cutting does not divide.
 
 
Thirty
He who uses Dao to assist the master of the people
Does not use weapons or strength on the world,
For his troubles would likely return –
In the dwelling places of armies, thorns and brambles are
      produced,
And so what is left behind a great army must have a bad
      year.
 
He who has virtue gets results and stops.
He does not dare to take by using strength.
He gets results, but never brags.          
Gets results, but never boasts.
Gets results, but is not arrogant.
Gets results, but only when he has no choice.
Gets results, but never uses strength.
 
When creatures are robust but old,
This is called “not Dao”.
That which is “not Dao” has an early finish.
 
 
Thirty one
Now : fine weapons, they are not tools of good fortune.
Creatures detest them, no matter what.
Therefore : he who possesses Dao does not live by them.
When a noble man is in his dwelling, then he honors the
      left.
When he commands troops, then he honors the right.
 
Weapons, they are not tools of good fortune.
They are not the tools of a noble man.
When he has no choice but to use them,
To be calm and indifferent is superior –
Never pleased, indeed!
And he who is pleased enjoys killing people.
 
Now : he who enjoys killing people
Can not get what he desires from the world!
 
Therefore : in fortunate affairs honor the left,
In unfortunate affairs honor the right.
Thus the assistant general of the army resides on the left,
The supreme general of the army resides on the right.
 
Thus we say they are dwelling at a funeral :
When many people are killed,
Then mourn and weep with grief for them.
Victory in war thus means they will dwell at a funeral.
 
 
Thirty two
Dao is ever-constantly without-name.
 
Even though the concept of the uncarved block seems
      insignificant,
No one in the world can conquer it.
If nobles and kings could maintain it,
The ten thousand creatures would naturally obey.
Heaven and earth would join with each other,
Thus dropping a sweet dew.
There are no citizens who would make this happen,
Yet it would be naturally fair and impartial.
 
And so, begin to divide and you have names.
Once names exist,
Men should also be ready to know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop is the reason that there is no
      danger.
 
An analogy for the action of Dao in the world :
It is similar to a stream in a valley that becomes part of a
      large river or ocean.
 
 
Thirty four
Great Dao is like a vast flood!
It is able to flow left and right.
 
The ten thousand creatures depend on it in order for life,
And are not rejected.
It accomplishes its tasks successfully,
Yet does not possess a name.
It clothes and supports the ten thousand creatures,
But does not act as their master.
 
Therefore : since it is ever-constantly without-desire,
It can then be named insignificant.
 
Since the ten thousand creatures return to it
But it does not act as their master,
It can then be named great.
 
Thus the sage can achieve greatness   
Because he does not act great.
Therefore he can achieve greatness.
 
 
Thirty five
Holding fast to the great image,
The entire world comes towards you.
Comes towards you, and meeting with no harm,
There is the greatest peace and calm.
 
Music together with good food make passing guests stay,
But Dao’s words are bland!
They are without flavor.
 
Look for it, there is not enough to see.
Listen for it, there is not enough to hear.
Use it, there is not enough to exhaust.
 
 
Thirty seven
Dao ever-constantly resides in non-action,
Yet nothing is left undone.
 
If nobles and kings could maintain it,
The ten thousand creatures would naturally transform.
Transform, and if desire arises,
I would restrain it by means of the nameless uncarved
      block.           
 
In the state of the nameless uncarved block,
Men also would be without-desire.
Not desiring, thus they would be still –
And the world would naturally settle.
 
 
Thirty nine
Of those who in ancient times attained oneness :
Heaven attained oneness, thus becoming pure and clear.
Earth attained oneness, thus becoming stable.
Spirit attained oneness, thus becoming potent.
The valley attained oneness, thus becoming full.
The ten thousand creatures attained oneness, thus
      becoming alive.
Nobles and kings attained oneness, thus serving the
      world faithfully.
They attained it.
 
If heaven could not use its purity and clarity,
I fear it would split apart.
If earth could not use its stability,
I fear it would erupt.
If spirit could not use its potency,
I fear it would cease to be.
If the valley could not use its fullness,
I fear it would be used up.
If the ten thousand creatures could not use their life,
I fear they would be destroyed.
If nobles and kings could not use their high rank and
      prominence,
I fear they would fall.
 
Therefore : humility thus serves as the source of high
      rank;
Low thus serves as the foundation of high.
Thus nobles and kings call themselves orphaned, lonely,
        and unlucky.
Does this not mean that humility thus serves as the
      source?
Does it not?
 
Therefore : to attain exceptional popularity is to be
      without popularity –
Do not desire to be scarce like jade,
But common like rock.
 
 
Forty one
The superior scholar hearing of Dao works hard and
      practices it.
The average scholar hearing of Dao seems to keep it,
      seems to lose it.
The inferior scholar hearing of Dao laughs greatly at it.
If he did not laugh, it would not be qualified to be Dao.
 
Therefore : in the established sayings that exist, it is
      said –
Insight into Dao seems like darkness.
Advancing in Dao seems like retreating.
Smooth Dao seems knotted.
Superior De seems like a valley.
The greatest purity seems like disgrace.
The most extensive De seems like it is not enough.
Established De seems aimless.
Real and true character seems inconsistent.
 
The greatest region is without borders.
The greatest vessel is last to be completed.
The greatest tone is a tenuous sound.
The greatest image is without-form.
Dao is hidden and without-name.
 
Now : only Dao is good at beginning and also good at
      completing.
 
 
Forty four
Fame and self : which do you love?
Self and property : which is greater?
Gain and loss : which is the affliction?
 
Extreme desire must lead to great expense.
Collecting too much must lead to substantial loss.
 
Knowing when you have enough, there can be no
      disgrace.
Knowing when to stop, there can be no danger.
Then you can forever endure.
 
 
Fifty one
Dao creates them,
De raises them,
Things shape them,
Circumstances complete them.
 
Thus among the ten thousand creatures,
There are none who do not respect Dao and honor De.
Respect of Dao,
Honor of De –
Now : there is no one who commands this,
Yet it is always naturally so.
 
Therefore : Dao creates them, De raises them.
Leads them, nourishes them,
Shelters them, heals  them,
Supports them, protects them.
 
Creating but not possessing,
Acting but not concerned with the results,
Leading yet not governing –
This is called deep and mysterious De.
 
 
Fifty two
The world had a beginning,
Which can be considered the mother of the world.
Once you have realized its mother,
You thus know her children.
Once you know her children,
Return to and maintain their mother.
 
When the self disappears, there can be no danger.     
 
Block your senses, close your gateway –
All your life you will not struggle.
Open your senses, be successful in your duties –
All your life you will not have relief.
 
Seeing the insignificant speaks of insight.
Maintaining softness speaks of strength.
Use your brightness to return to your insight.
Do not lose your self in misfortune.
This is called practicing the ever-constant.
 
 
Fifty five
He who embodies the substance of De
Can be compared to a newborn child :
Wasps, scorpions, snakes, and serpents do not sting him,
Fierce beasts do not seize him,
Birds of prey do not claw him.                                   
His bones are weak, his muscles are soft, yet his grasp is
      firm and strong.
He has not yet known the union of female and male, yet
      his penis rises.
He has the utmost essence, indeed!
He cries the entire day yet does not get hoarse.
He has the utmost harmony, indeed!
 
Knowing harmony speaks of the ever-constant.
Knowing the ever-constant speaks of insight.
Benefitting life speaks of good fortune.
Heart/mind making Qi speaks of strength.
 
When creatures are robust but old,
We call them “not Dao”.
That which is “not Dao” has an early finish.
 
 
Fifty six
He who knows does not speak;
He who speaks does not know.
 
Block your senses, close your gateway.
Blunt your sharpness,
Loosen your tangles,
Soften your brightness,
Be the same as the dust of the world.
This is called a deep and mysterious sameness.
 
Therefore : you can not gain it and be friendly,
Can not gain it and be unfriendly,
Can not gain it and benefit,
Can not gain it and cause harm,
Can not gain it and have high rank,
Can not gain it and be lowly.
 
Therefore you become valuable to the world.

Not honoring those who are esteemable
Ensures that the citizens do not strive.
Not valuing rare goods
Ensures that the citizens do not act like thieves.
Not showing that which can be desired
Ensures that the citizens’ heart/minds do not become
      confused.
 
Thus the governing of the sage
Empties their heart/minds, fills their stomachs,
Weakens their ambitions, strengthens their bones.
 
By always ensuring that the citizens are
      without-knowledge and without-desire,
Those who make men wise will not dare to act.
 
Act with non-action, then all will be governed!
 
 
Eight
The highest virtue is like water –
Water’s virtue benefits the ten thousand creatures, yet it
      does not strive.
It dwells in places that everyone detests,
Therefore it is almost comparable to Dao!
 
In dwelling, the virtue is in the land.
In your heart/mind, the virtue is in being profound and
      deep.
In relations, the virtue is in being kind.
In speech, the virtue is in being truthful.
In governing, the virtue is in being honest and just.
In your duties, the virtue is in being competent.
In action, the virtue is in the timing.
 
Now : only because there is no striving,
Therefore there is no blame.
 
 
Twelve
The five colors can make people’s eyes blind.
The five tones can make people’s ears deaf.
The five flavors can make people’s mouths dull.
Excessive hunting and horse racing can make people’s
      heart/minds become wild.  
Rare goods can make people’s behavior corrupt.       
 
Thus the sage :
Acts on what is inside, he does not act on what he sees.
Therefore he leaves that and chooses this.
 
 
Seventeen
The existence of the best ruler is barely known to the
      people.
Next is one who they love and praise.
Next is one who they fear.
Next is one who they ridicule.
 
If the ruler does not trust enough, then he will not have
      anyone’s trust.
 
Thoughtful!, he values his words.
 
When tasks are accomplished and duties are successful,
The 100 families all say “we are naturally so”.
 
 
Eighteen
When the great Dao is abandoned,
There exists kindness and morality.
 
When intelligence and wisdom arise,
There exists a great deal of deception.
 
When the six relationships are not in harmony,
There exists devoted children and loving parents.
 
When the nation and the families are very confused,
There exists loyal officials.
 
 
Nineteen
Renounce sacredness, abandon wisdom,
And the citizens benefit 100-fold.
Renounce kindness, abandon morality,
And the citizens return to being devoted children and
      loving parents.
Renounce cleverness, abandon profit,
And thieves and bandits will not exist.
 
These three things thus make a civilized society, but are
      not enough.
 
Therefore : to ensure the citizens have a place to belong–
See the simplicity,
Embrace the concept of the uncarved block,
Less selfishness,
Fewer desires.
 
 
Twenty two
What is wrong then becomes whole and perfect.
What is bent then becomes straight.
What is hollow then becomes filled.
What is worn out then becomes new.
Have little, then gain.
Have too much, then become confused.
 
Thus the sage :
Embraces the One, thus serving as an example to the
      world –
He does not display himself, therefore he has insight.
Does not consider himself correct, therefore he
      distinguishes himself.
Does not boast about himself, therefore he possesses
      merit.
Does not brag about himself, therefore he endures.
 
Now : only because he does not strive,
Therefore no one in the world can strive against him.
 
That which the ancients say :
“He who is wrong then becomes whole and perfect” –
How can these be empty words?
Be truly whole and perfect, and return to it.
 
 
Twenty seven
A good traveler is without wagon track or footprint.
A good speaker is without flaw or disgrace.
A good accountant does not use counting tokens.
A good barrier is without bar or lock, yet can not be
      opened.
A good binding is without cord or restraint, yet can not
      be loosened.
 
Thus the sage :
Is always good at helping people,
Therefore he does not abandon people.          
Is always good at helping creatures,
Therefore he does not abandon creatures.
This is called following your insight.
 
Therefore : he who is a virtuous person is the teacher of
      he who is not a virtuous person.
He who is not a virtuous person is the resource of he
      who is a virtuous person.  
If the latter does not value his teacher,
Or the former does not love his resource,
Even if there is wisdom, there will be great confusion.
This is called the essential subtle mystery.
 
 
Twenty nine
Would you take hold of the world and control it?      
I see you have no choice.
 
Now : the world is a divine vessel,
You can not control it (indeed!).
He who acts, ruins it;
He who grasps, loses it.
 
Therefore : creatures are
Sometimes active, sometimes passive,
Sometimes breathe heavy, sometimes breathe easy,
Sometimes strong, sometimes weak,
Sometimes oppressed, sometimes overthrown.
 
Thus the sage :
Removes the extremes,
Removes the extravagant and wasteful,
Removes the arrogance.
 
 
Thirty eight
A man of highest De does not use his De, thus he
      possesses De.
A man of inferior De does not lose his De, thus he is
      without De.
 
A man of highest De uses non-action, and acts without
      motive.                                  
A man of inferior De coerces others, and has a motive to
      act.
A man of highest kindness coerces others, and acts
      without motive.       
A man of highest morality coerces others, and has a
      motive to act.
A man of highest propriety coerces others, and if there
      is no one who responds,
Then he rolls up his sleeves and keeps doing it.
 
Therefore : lose Dao, and later comes De.
Lose De, and later comes kindness.
Lose kindness, and later comes morality.
Lose morality, and later comes propriety.
Now : propriety is that which is merely the appearance
      of loyalty and honesty,
And the beginning of confusion.
 
He who is ahead in knowledge has the flower of Dao,
But the beginning of stupidity and foolishness.
 
Thus the greatest elders :
Live by Dao’s substance, and do not dwell on Dao’s
      appearance.
Live on Dao’s fruit, and do not dwell on Dao’s flower.         
Therefore they leave that and choose this.
 
 
Forty five
Great achievement seems incomplete,
But its usefulness is not impaired.
 
Great fullness is like a cup or bowl,
Its usefulness is not exhausted.
 
Great straightness seems bent.
Great skillfulness seems clumsy.
Great debaters seem slow of speech.
 
Restlessness conquers cold.
Stillness conquers heat.
 
Purity and clarity along with stillness makes the world
      proper and correct.
 
 
Forty six
When the world possesses Dao,
Riding horses are nonetheless used for manure.
When the world is without Dao,
War-horses are bred in the countryside.                                             
 
There is no fault greater than the capacity for desire.
There is no misfortune greater than not knowing when
      you have enough.
There is no error greater than desire for gain.
 
Therefore : knowing the sufficiency of having enough,
      there is always enough!
 
 
Forty seven
You do not have to go out the door
In order to to know the world.
You do not have to look out the window        
In order to to know the Way of heaven.                     
 
The farther you go out,
You know even less.
 
Thus the sage :
Does not travel, yet knows.
Does not display himself, yet has a reputation.
Does not act, yet accomplishes.
 
 
Forty eight
The actions of those who learn daily increase.
The actions of those who Dao daily decrease.
Decreasing and again decreasing,
In order to arrive at non-action.
 
Use non-action, and nothing is left undone.
To take hold of the world, always use non-interference.
When you are compelled  to interfere,
Then you are not qualified to take hold of the world.
 
 
Forty nine
The sage does not have a constant heart/mind,
Thus the 100 families’ heart/minds become his
      heart/mind.
 
He who is virtuous, I am virtuous to him.
He who is not virtuous, I am also virtuous to him.
Because De is virtue.
 
He who is honest, I am honest with him.
He who is not honest, I am also honest with him.
Because De is honesty.
 
The sage lives in the world, gathering it all in.
And so he serves the world, merging with their
      heart/minds.
 
The 100 families all pay attention to their ears and eyes,
And the sage treats them all like his children.
 
 
Fifty three
If I correctly use the tiniest bit of knowledge that I
      possess
While travelling on the great Way,
It is only walking off the path that I need to fear.
The great Way is extremely even,
But the citizens are fond of side paths.
 
Although the royal court is very well-kept,
The fields are very overgrown with weeds,
The granaries are very empty.
While at the court they wear refined multicolored silks,
Carry sharp swords,
Stuff themselves with drink and food,
And have an excess of wealth and goods.
 
This is called robbery and extravagance,
Not Dao, indeed!!
 
 
Fifty four
That which is well established is not uprooted.
That which is well embraced is not abandoned.
Thus children and grandchildren offer sacrifices, and so
      sacrifices do not stop.
 
Cultivate it in the self – your De will then be true and
      real.
Cultivate it in the family – its De will then be more than
      enough.
Cultivate it in the village – its De will then last forever.
Cultivate it in the nation – its De will then be abundant.
Cultivate it in the world – its De will then be everywhere.
 
Therefore : use your self to contemplate the self.
Use your family to contemplate the family.
Use your village to contemplate the village.
Use your nation to contemplate the nation.
Use the world to contemplate the world.
 
How do I thus know the world is like this?
By means of this.
 
 
Fifty seven
Use honesty and justness when governing a nation.
Use strange and unusual tactics when commanding
      troops.
Use non-interference to take hold of the world.
How do I thus know it is like this?
By means of this :
 
The world has many prohibitions and taboos,
And the citizens become even poorer.
The citizens have many sharp tools,
And the nation and the families grow in confusion.
The people have too much knowledge and cleverness,
And strange things begin to increase.
Matters of law are increasingly proclaimed,
And more thieves and bandits exist.
 
Therefore : the sage says –
I use non-action, and the citizens naturally transform.
I cherish stillness, and the citizens naturally become
      honest and just.
I use non-interference, and the citizens naturally become
      wealthy.
I am without-desire, and the citizens naturally return to
      the state of the uncarved block.
 
 
Fifty eight
If their government is very restrained,
Its citizens will be very genuine and honest.
If their government is very observant and alert,
Its citizens will be very lacking and deficient.
 
Misfortune! is that which good fortune leans on.        
Good fortune! is that which misfortune lies on.
Who knows their limits?
They are not honest and just.
Honesty and justness returns, becoming strange and
      unusual.
Virtue returns, becoming weird and strange.
 
The confusion of the people –
Its days have indeed been everlasting.
 
Thus the sage :
Is honest and does not divide,
Is honorable and does not injure,
Is straightforward and does not indulge in excess,
Is bright but does not dazzle.
 
 
Fifty nine
When governing people or doing heaven’s duties,
It is better to be sparing.
 
Now : only when you can be sparing,
This is called early acceptance.
Early acceptance is called doubling your accumulation
      of De.
With a double accumulation of De,
Then everything can be overcome.
When everything can be overcome,
Then no one knows your limits.
When no one knows your limits,
You can possess the nation.
Possessing the mother of the nation,
You can forever endure.
 
This is called having a deep source and a firm
      foundation,
The Way of long life and enduring sight.
 
 
Sixty
Governing a great nation is like cooking a small fish.
 
Because Dao is present in the world,
Its ghosts do not have spirit.
 
Not that its ghosts do not have any spirit,
But their spirit does not injure people.
 
Not only does their spirit not injure people,
The sage also does not injure people.
 
Now : since these two do not injure each other,
Therefore their De merges and returns!
 
 
Sixty one
A great nation is like the lowest places water can flow –
The merging place of the world,
The female of the world.
 
The female always uses stillness to conquer the male.
By using stillness, she becomes lower-than.
 
Therefore : if a great nation is lower-than a small nation,
Then it takes hold of the small nation.
If a small nation is lower-than a great nation,
Then it is taken hold of by the great nation.
 
Therefore : sometimes one nation is lower-than in order
      to take hold of,
Sometimes one nation is lower-than and then it is taken
      hold of.
 
A great nation merely desires to combine livestock and
      people,
A small nation merely desires to get work for its people.
Now : for both nations to each get that which is their
      desire,
It is proper for the great nation to be lower-than.
 
 
Sixty two
That which Daos is the obscure mystery of the ten
      thousand creatures.
This is the treasure of a virtuous person,
And that which is the protection of a person who is not
      virtuous.
 
Beautiful speech can be used in the market,
Respectful behavior can benefit people.
People who are not virtuous,
Why abandon them?
 
Therefore : when inaugurating the son of heaven,
Or installing the three nobles –
Even if you possessed jade disks drawn by a team of
      four horses,                                  
That is not as good as sitting and offering this Way.
 
What was the ancients’ reason that they valued this Way?
Did they not say :
Seek in order to obtain,
Have faults in order to be forgiven?
 
Therefore Dao becomes valuable to the world.
 
 
Sixty three
Act with non-action.
Handle duties with non-interference.
Taste that which is without-flavor.
 
Greatness is insignificant, too much is less.
Repay animosity with De.
 
Plan for the difficult while it is easy.
Act on the great while it is tiny.
In the world, difficult duties certainly start while easy.
In the world, great duties certainly start while tiny.
 
Thus the sage in the end does not act great,
Therefore he can achieve his greatness.
 
Men who make promises lightly, certainly few will trust.
Men who expect most duties to be easy will certainly
      have many difficulties.
 
Thus the sage plans for things to be difficult,
Therefore in the end he is without difficulty!
 
 
Sixty four
What is peaceful is easy to hold.        
What has not yet been revealed is easy to plan for.
What is brittle is easy to shatter.          
What is minute is easy to scatter.
Act on it while it does not yet exist.
Govern them while they are not yet confused.
 
A tree too big to embrace is created from the tiniest
      shoot.
A terrace of nine stories rises from a pile of dirt.
A journey of a thousand miles begins from under the feet.
 
He who acts, ruins it.
He who grasps, loses it.
 
Thus the sage :
Does not act, therefore he does not ruin.
Does not grasp, therefore he does not lose.
 
Citizens are always on the verge of achieving their
      undertakings, yet they ruin them.  
Be as careful in the end as if it was the beginning,
Then you will not ruin your affairs.
 
Thus the sage :
Desires to not desire,
Does not value rare goods,
Learns to not learn.
 
He returns to that which everyone else has passed over,
Thus helping the ten thousand creatures to be naturally
      so,
Yet not daring to act.
 
 
Sixty five
The virtue of the ancients (they who acted in Dao),
Did not use it to enlighten the citizens,
But would have used it to keep them ignorant –
The citizens are hard to govern
Because they have too much knowledge.
 
Therefore : using knowledge to govern the nation
Is the bane of the nation.
Not using knowledge to govern the nation
Is the good fortune of the nation.
He who has knowledge of these two also has them as
      examples.
 
To always understand these examples –
This is called deep and mysterious De.
Deep and mysterious De is so profound! and remote!
That when creatures return, it returns with them!
Then they reach the greatest harmony.
 
 
Sixty six
The reason that rivers and seas can act as kings of the
      100 valleys
Is because they are good at being lower-than them.    
Therefore : they can act as kings of the 100 valleys.
 
Thus the sage :
In desiring to be above the citizens,
He must by means of his speech be lower-than them.
In desiring to be before the citizens,
He must by means of his self be behind them.
 
Thus the sage :
Lives above them, but the citizens are not burdened.
Lives in front of them, but the citizens are not harmed.
Thus the world is pleased to promote him, and does not
      tire of him.
 
Because he does not strive,
Therefore no one in the world can strive against him.

POST-GUODIAN
 
Eleven
Thirty spokes of a wheel share one hub;
In its emptiness exists the usefulness of the cart.
 
Mix water with clay thus making a vessel;
In its emptiness exists the usefulness of the vessel.
 
Cut out doors and windows thus making a room;       
In their emptiness exists the usefulness of the room.
 
Therefore : what exists thus makes a thing profitable;
Emptiness thus makes it useful.
 
 
Twenty six
Serious serves as the source of frivolous.
Stillness serves as the ruler of restlessness.
Thus the noble man travels the entire day,
And does not stray from his wagon.
He is serious, even though glorious sights and feasts
      exist;
He lives above them, like this.
So how could one be the master of ten thousand chariots,
And conduct his self frivolously in the world?    
 
Be frivolous, then lose the source.
Be restless, then lose the rulership.
 
 
Thirty three
He who knows people is wise;
He who knows himself has insight.
 
He who is victorious over people possesses power;
He who is victorious over himself is strong.
 
He who knows he has enough is wealthy;
He who uses force possesses ambition.
 
He who does not lose his place endures;
He who dies yet does not perish has longevity.
 
 
Thirty six
When you are about to gather something,
You must have originally spread it out.
When you are about to weaken something,
You must have originally strengthened it.
When you are about to abandon something,
You must have originally been interested in it.
When you are about to seize something,
You must have originally given it.
 
This is called subtle and obscure insight.
 
What is soft and weak conquers what is hard and strong.
 
Fish can not escape from the deep;
The sharp tools of the nation
Can not be shown to the people.
 
 
Forty
The movement of Dao returns things.
The function of Dao is to weaken things.
 
The ten thousand creatures of the world are created from
      being;
Being is created from non-being.
 
 
Forty two
Dao creates one.
One creates two.
Two creates three.
Three creates the ten thousand creatures.
The ten thousand creatures carry Yin and embrace Yang,
Pouring their Qi together, thus becoming harmonious.
 
That which people detest :
Being alone, orphaned, lonely, and unlucky –
Yet kings and nobles thus name themselves.
 
Therefore : creatures
Sometimes lose, yet they gain;
Sometimes gain, yet they lose.
 
That which people teach, I also teach :
Those who are bullies and hoodlums do not meet their
      natural death.
I will thus become their elder teacher.
 
 
Forty three
The softest things of the world
Overrun the hardest things of the world.
 
Non-being can enter where there is no space in between.
Thus I know that non-action has benefits.
 
The teaching of no-talking,
The benefit of non-action –
Few in the world attain these.
 
 
Fifty
Between coming out into life and entering death,
Followers of life are 3 in 10.
Followers of death are 3 in 10.
People whose lives are merely moving them towards the
      place of death
Are also 3 in 10.
 
Now : what is the reason?
Because they live life for its substance.
 
But I have heard that he who is skilled at taking in life
Can travel the mountains and does not meet rhino or
      tiger,
Can enter a battle not wearing armor or weapons.
The rhino has no place to thrust its horns,
The tiger has no place to use its claws,
The weapon has no place to allow its blade.
 
Now : what is the reason?
Because for him there is no place of death.
 
 
Sixty seven
In the world, all say I am great,
But do not seem to be like everyone else.
Now : only because I am not  like everyone else,
       therefore I can be great.
If I was like everyone else,
Long ago! I would have become insignificant, indeed!
 
Now :  I possess three treasures –
Hold and maintain them.
The first is called compassion,
The second is called economy,
The third is called not daring to act first in the world.
 
With compassion, you can therefore be brave.
With economy, you can therefore expand.
By not daring to act first in the world,
Therefore you can achieve the capacity for leadership.
 
At present, people abandon compassion but also try to be
      brave,
Abandon economy but also try to expand,
Abandon being behind but also try to be first –
This is death!
 
Now : when compassion is used in war, the consequence
      is victory.
When it is used for protection, the consequence is
      strength.
When heaven would help you,
Using compassion it protects you.
 
 
Sixty eight
He who is good at being a scholar is not militant.
He who is good at war does not get angry.
He who is good at conquering the enemy does not
      engage them.
He who is good at making use of people acts lower-than
      them.
 
This is called the De of not striving.
This is called the power of making use of people.
This is called joining the elite of heaven’s ancients,
      indeed!
 
 
Sixty nine
Those who command troops have a saying :
I dare not act like the master, but instead act like a guest.
Dare not advance an inch, but instead retreat a foot.
 
This is called marching without marching,
Seizing without using your arms,
Routing without having an enemy,
Defending without using weapons.
 
There is no misfortune greater than underestimating the
      enemy.
By underestimating the enemy, I nearly lose my
       treasures.
 
Therefore : when armies on opposing sides are evenly
      matched,
Then they who mourn will be victorious!
 
 
Seventy
My words are very easy to understand,
Very easy to practice.
But there is no one in the world who can understand
      them,
There is no one who can practice them.
 
My words possess a lineage,
My duties possess a ruler.
 
Now : only because I am without-knowledge,
Thus I am not understood.
Those who understand me are rare,
Consequently I am one who is valued!
 
Thus the sage wears coarse cloth, but carries jade in his
      heart.
 
 
Seventy one
Knowing that you do not know is honorable!
Not knowing that you know is a sickness!
 
Now : only when you are sick of sickness,
Thus you are not sick.
 
The sage is not sick
Because he is sick of sickness.
Thus he is not sick.
 
 
Seventy two
If the citizens do not fear your authority,
Then a greater authority will arrive!
 
Do not disrespect their dwellings,
Do not despise their livelihood.
 
Now : only because you do not despise them,
Thus they will not tire of you.
 
Thus the sage :
Knows himself but not display himself,
Loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Therefore he leaves that and chooses this.
 
 
Seventy three
When your courage lies in daring,
The consequence is killing.
When your courage lies in not daring,
The consequence is survival.
 
These two choices, they sometimes cause benefit,
      sometimes cause harm.
That which heaven detests – who knows its reasons?
 
The Way of heaven :
Does not strive, yet skillfully achieves its goals.
Does not speak, yet skillfully responds.
Does not summon, yet everything naturally comes to it.
Is certainly unhurried, yet skillfully prepares.
 
Heaven’s net is extremely vast;
It is wide meshed, yet does not fail.
 
 
Seventy four
If the citizens do not fear death,
How can you use death to frighten them?
Assuming you could ensure that the citizens always fear
      death,
And I get hold of those who act strange and unusual and
      kill them,
Then who would be daring?
 
There will always exist an executioner.
Now : to take the place of the executioner to do the
      killing,
This is called taking the place of a great craftsman to
      carve wood.
Now : of those who take the place of a great craftsman to
      carve wood,
Few will not injure their hand!
 
 
Seventy five
The citizens are hungry
Because their superiors eat too much of their taxes.
Thus they are hungry.
 
The citizens are hard to govern
Because their superiors are compelled to take action.
Thus they are hard to govern.
 
The citizens take death lightly
Because they seek the substance of life.
Thus they take death lightly.
 
Now : only he who has no use for being alive
Is virtuous compared to he who values living.
 
 
Seventy six
The people are born (indeed!) soft and weak.
They die (indeed!) hard and inflexible.
The ten thousand creatures, the grass and trees, are born
      (indeed!) soft and fragile.
They die (indeed!) dried and withered.
 
Therefore : that which is hard and inflexible is a follower
      of death.
That which is soft and weak is a follower of life.
 
Thus if a weapon is inflexible, the consequence is defeat.     
If a tree is inflexible, then it snaps.
 
Inflexible and great dwell below.
Soft and weak dwell above.
 
 
Seventy seven
The Way of heaven, how it is just like stretching a bow?
He who is high is pressed down by it.
He who is low is lifted by it.
He who has excess is reduced by it.
He who does not have enough is filled by it.
 
The Way of heaven
Reduces what has excess and fills what does not have
      enough.
The Way of people on the other hand is not like this,
And takes from those who do not have enough in order to
      offer it to those who have too much.
 
Who can have too much and offer it to the world?
Only he who possesses Dao.
 
Thus the sage :
Acts, but is not concerned with the results.
Accomplishes his tasks, but does not dwell on them.
He does not desire to display his virtue.
 
 
Seventy eight
In the world, nothing is softer and weaker than water.
Yet for attacking that which is hard and strong,
There is nothing that can surpass it.
This is because it endlessly replaces itself.
 
Weakness conquers strength.
Softness conquers hardness.
In the world, there is no one who does not know this,
But there is no one who can practice it.
 
Thus the sage says :
Accepting upon oneself the disgrace of the nation
Is called being master of the shrines.
Accepting upon oneself the misfortune of the nation
Is called being king of the world.
 
Honest words seem contrary.
 

Seventy nine
Harmonize a great resentment,
And there must exist some remaining resentment.
How can this be considered good?
 
Thus the sage :
Holds the left side of an agreement,
But does not demand payment of people.
 
Therefore : to have De is to take charge of your
      agreements;
To be without De is to take charge of taking away from
      others.
 
The Way of heaven, while without favor,
Is always with virtuous people.
 
 
Eighty
In a small nation with few citizens :
Ensure that it has the weapons of ten nobles, but does not
      use them.
Ensure that the citizens take death seriously, and do not
      migrate far.
Even though they have boats and carriages, there is no
      place to take advantage of them.
Even though they have armor and weapons, there is no
      place to display them.
 
Ensure that the citizens return to knotting ropes and using
      them,
Find deliciousness in their food,
Beauty in their clothes,
Contentment in their dwellings,
Happiness in their customs.
 
Although neighboring nations overlook one another,
And sounds of roosters and dogs can be heard in one
      another –
The citizens reach old age and die,
And do not come and go between one another.
 
 
Eighty one
True words are not beautiful;
Beautiful words are not true.
 
He who has virtue does not argue;
He who argues does not have virtue.
 
He who knows is not learned;
He who is learned does not know.
 
The sage does not accumulate things –
Since through serving people, the more one has;
Since through giving to people, one has even more.
 
The Way of heaven benefits and does not cause harm.
The Way of the sage acts yet does not strive.
 
 
 
As mentioned above, chapter 2 seems to be a truly “mongrel” chapter, with characteristics that indicate it belongs to all three layers, and none of them.  Therefore, it is presented here, separate from the other layers.
 
Two
In the world, when all know that the action of beauty is
      beautiful, then ugliness ensues.
When all know that the action of good is goodness, then
      not-good ensues.                   
 
Therefore : being and non-being create each other,
Difficult and easy complete each other,
Long and short contrast each other,
High and low lean on each other,
Tone and voice harmonize each other,
Before and after follow each other.
 
Thus the sage :
Lives by using non-action in his duties,
And practicing no-talking in his teachings.
 
The ten thousand creatures arise, but do not have a
      beginning.
Creating but not possessing;
Acting, but not concerned with the results;
Accomplishing tasks, but not dwelling on them.         
 
Now : only because there is no dwelling,
Thus the results do not depart.
 
 
WHAT WOULD THE SAGE DO?
Thus the sage :
Lives by using non-action in his duties,
And practicing no-talking in his teachings.
 
Thus the governing of the sage
Empties their heart/minds, fills their bellies,
Weakens their ambitions, strengthens their bones.
 
The sage is not kind;
Thus the 100 families become as straw dogs to him.
 
Thus the sage :
Puts his self behind others, yet finds his self before them.
Considers his self extraneous, yet his self survives.
Is this not because he has no self-interests?
Therefore he can achieve his self-interests.
 
Thus the sage :
Acts on what is inside, he does not act on what he sees.
Therefore he leaves that and chooses this.
 
Thus the sage :
Embraces the One, thus serving as an example to the
      world –
He does not display himself, therefore he has insight.
Does not consider himself correct, therefore he
      distinguishes himself.
Does not boast about himself, therefore he possesses
      merit.
Does not brag about himself, therefore he endures.
Now : only because he does not strive,
Therefore no one in the world can strive against him.
 
Thus the sage :
Is always good at helping people,
Therefore he does not abandon people.          
Is always good at helping creatures,
Therefore he does not abandon creatures.
This is called following your insight.
 
Thus the sage :
Removes the extremes,
Removes the extravagant and wasteful,
Removes the arrogance.
 
Thus the sage can achieve greatness   
Because he does not act great.
Therefore he can achieve greatness.
 
Thus the sage :
Does not travel, yet knows.
Does not display himself, yet has a reputation.
Does not act, yet accomplishes.
 
 
The sage does not have a constant heart/mind,
Thus the 100 families’ heart/minds become his
      heart/mind.
 
The sage lives in the world, taking it all in.
And so he serves the world, merging with their
      heart/minds.
 
The 100 families all pay attention to their ears and eyes,
And the sage treats them all like his children.
 
Therefore : the sage says –
I use non-action, and the citizens naturally transform.
I cherish stillness, and the citizens naturally become
      honest and just.
I use non-interference, and the citizens naturally become
      wealthy.
I am without-desire, and the citizens naturally return to
      the state of the uncarved block.
 
Thus the sage :
Is honest and does not divide,
Is honorable and does not injure,
Is straightforward and does not indulge in excess,
Is bright but does not dazzle.
 
The sage also does not injure people.
 
Thus the sage in the end does not act great,
Therefore he can achieve his greatness.
 
Thus the sage plans for things to be difficult,
Therefore in the end he is without difficulty!
 
Thus the sage :
Does not act, therefore he does not ruin.
Does not grasp, therefore he does not lose.
 
Thus the sage :
Desires to not desire,
Does not value rare goods,
Learns to not learn.
 
Thus the sage :
In desiring to be above the citizens,
He must by means of his speech be lower-than them.
In desiring to be before the citizens,
He must by means of his self be behind them.
 
Thus the sage :
Lives above them, but the citizens are not burdened.
Lives in front of them, but the citizens are not harmed.
Thus the world is pleased to promote him, and does not
      tire of him.
 
Thus the sage wears coarse cloth, but carries jade in his
      heart.
 
The sage is not sick
Because he is sick of sickness.
Thus he is not sick.
 
Thus the sage :
Knows himself but not display himself,
Loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Therefore he leaves that and chooses this.
 
Thus the sage :
Acts, but is not concerned with the results.
Accomplishes his tasks, but does not dwell on them.
He does not desire to display his virtue.
 
Thus the sage says :
Accepting upon oneself the disgrace of the nation
Is called being master of the shrines.
Accepting upon oneself the misfortune of the nation
Is called being king of the world.
 
Thus the sage :
Holds the left side of an agreement,
But does not demand payment of people.
 
The sage does not accumulate things –
Since through serving people, the more one has;
Since through giving to people, one has even more.
 
The Way of the sage acts yet does not strive.
