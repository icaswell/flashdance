In another visualization of the sheer power of feminine beauty, this chengyu describes a woman whose looks make “fish sink and geese fall out of the sky.” In English we might say she is “breath-taking” or “stunning.” As a historical note, this phrase was first used almost 2,000 years ago by the philosopher and poet 庄子  (zhuāng zi) — Zhuangzi in his work 齐物论  (qí wù lùn) — “Equality of Things.”
谁也不能漂亮一辈子的，就算你曾经是个沉鱼落雁的主儿，那也有老去的那一天。

In a dilemma

Explanation
Here, 破镜 refers to a broken mirror and 重圆 means becoming complete again. It’s sometimes used like the English saying “to pick up the pieces and start again,” especially after a long separation.
