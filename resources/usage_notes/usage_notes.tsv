It often implies a specific problem or issue is being addressed, or a particular group is being targeted.  对 is more general and can be used in a wider range of situations where something is simply directed at or towards something else.  Think of 针对 as "specifically targeting" and 对 as "towards" or "at."

In other words, 根据 is more about the basis, while 按照 is more about the manner of implementation.<NEWLINE><NEWLINE>Contexts: 根据 is usually used with rules, e.g. 规定 (guīdìng), 法律 (fǎlǜ) etc. On the other hand, 按照 is usually used with requests or directions, e.g. 要求 (yāoqiú), 说法 (shuōfǎ), etc.<NEWLINE><NEWLINE>Finally, a different related word is 依照 (yīzhào).

Here are some key points to remember:<NEWLINE><NEWLINE>1. **Connecting clauses with a contrastive or adversative relationship:** This is the most common usage of 而, similar to "but" or "yet" in English.  It implies a contrast or opposition between the two clauses.  For example: 他很努力，而没有成功 (Tā hěn nǔlì, ér méiyǒu chénggōng) - He worked hard, but didn't succeed.<NEWLINE><NEWLINE>2. **Connecting clauses with a sequential or consequential relationship:**  In this case, 而 can mean "and so" or "and then."  It indicates that the second clause follows naturally from the first.  For example:  天气很冷，而我穿了很多衣服 (Tiānqì hěn lěng, ér wǒ chuān le hěn duō yīfu) - The weather was cold, and so I wore a lot of clothes.<NEWLINE><NEWLINE>3. **Connecting verbs or adjectives:**  而 can be used to link two verbs or adjectives, often highlighting a contrast or difference.

For example:  雨停而云散 (Yǔ tíng ér yún sàn) - The rain stopped and the clouds dispersed.<NEWLINE><NEWLINE>5. **Formal usage:**  而 is more common in formal or written Chinese.  In spoken Chinese, other conjunctions like 可是 (kěshì) or 但是 (dànshì) are often used instead for the adversative meaning.<NEWLINE><NEWLINE>A key difference between 而 and other conjunctions like 但是 (dànshì) is that 而 emphasizes the connection between two clauses, while 但是 emphasizes the contrast.  Consider the difference between these two sentences:<NEWLINE><NEWLINE>* 他很努力，而没有成功 (Tā hěn nǔlì, ér méiyǒu chénggōng) - He worked hard, but didn't succeed. (Focus is on the connection between effort and lack of success)<NEWLINE>* 他很努力，但是没有成功 (Tā hěn nǔlì, dànshì méiyǒu chénggōng) - He worked hard, but didn't succeed. (Focus is on the contrast between effort and outcome)

A set of knives might be counted with 套 (tào) meaning "set."  刀 can also be used as a measure word itself, referring to cuts or stabs with a knife, e.g., 一刀 (yīdāo) - one cut/stab.<NEWLINE><NEWLINE>Colloquial usage:<NEWLINE>In certain dialects, 刀 (dāo) can be slang for a dollar (influenced by the similar-sounding word "dollar" in English).
